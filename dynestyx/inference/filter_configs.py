class BaseFilterConfig(abc.ABC):
    r"""Shared configuration options inherited by all filter configs.

    You do not instantiate this class directly; use one of the concrete
    subclasses (e.g. `KFConfig`, `PFConfig`).

    The `record_*` fields let you save intermediate filtering outputs into the
    NumPyro trace as `numpyro.deterministic` sites, making them accessible
    after inference (e.g. for plotting filtered trajectories).  `None` defers
    to the backend's default for that quantity.

    Attributes:
        record_filtered_states_mean (bool | None): Save the posterior mean
            \(\mathbb{E}[x_t \mid y_{1:t}]\) at each time step.
        record_filtered_states_cov (bool | None): Save the full posterior
            covariance at each step. Can be large — prefer
            `record_filtered_states_cov_diag` for high-dimensional states.
        record_filtered_states_cov_diag (bool | None): Save only the marginal
            variances (diagonal of the covariance) at each step.
        record_filtered_states_chol_cov (bool | None): Save the Cholesky
            factor of the posterior covariance (Gaussian filters only).
        record_filtered_particles (bool | None): Save the full particle array
            at each step (particle-based filters only).
        record_filtered_log_weights (bool | None): Save the log importance
            weights at each step (particle-based filters only).
        record_max_elems (int): Hard cap on total scalar elements saved across
            all `record_*` sites. Prevents accidentally filling device memory
            for long sequences or large state spaces. Defaults to `100_000`.
        cov_rescaling (float | None): Multiply all predicted covariances by
            this factor before the update. Values slightly above `1.0`
            implement covariance inflation, which can improve robustness when
            the model is misspecified. `None` disables rescaling.
        crn_seed (jax.Array | None): Fix the PRNG key for stochastic filters
            (EnKF, PF). Useful when differentiating through the filter:
            a fixed key makes the randomness a deterministic function of model
            parameters. `None` draws a fresh key each call.
        warn (bool): Whether or not to suppress warnings from filtering backends.
            Defaults to `True`.
        filter_source (FilterSource | None): Internal backend library. Set by
            each subclass; rarely needs to be changed manually.

@dataclasses.dataclass
class EnKFConfig(BaseFilterConfig):
    r"""Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) for discrete-time models.

    The **default filter** for discrete-time models. A good general-purpose
    filter for nonlinear models with Gaussian observations. Works with any
    differentiable or non-differentiable dynamics and scales well to moderate
    state dimensions. Cheaper per-step than the particle filter, but assumes
    observations are approximately Gaussian given the ensemble.

    The observation noise covariance must be **state-independent** (it may
    still depend on time or controls). Using a state-dependent scale with the
    cuthbert backend raises a `ValueError`; if you need heteroscedastic noise,
    use `PFConfig` instead.

    The primary tuning knob is `n_particles`, with more particles providing
    more accurate results at the cost of higher compute.
    If the ensemble collapses over long trajectories, increase
    `inflation_delta` slightly (e.g. `0.05`–`0.2`).

    Supports missing observations via NaNs.

    Attributes:
        n_particles (int): Number of ensemble members. More members give a
            better covariance estimate at higher compute cost. Defaults to
            `30`.
        crn_seed (jax.Array | None): Fixed PRNG key for the ensemble. Defaults
            to `jr.PRNGKey(0)`, i.e., common random numbers are used. This
            can reduce variance in gradient-based learning, but introduces
            further bias.
        perturb_measurements (bool | None): Add noise to observations before
            the ensemble update (stochastic EnKF). Set `False` for the
            square-root variant. `None` defers to the backend default.
        inflation_delta (float | None): Scale ensemble anomalies by
            \(\sqrt{1 + \delta}\) before the update to prevent collapse.
            `None` disables inflation.
        filter_source (FilterSource): Backend. Defaults to `"cuthbert"`.

    ??? note "Algorithm Reference"
        The ensemble Kalman filter comprises ensemble members $x_t^{(i)}, i = 1, \ldots, N_{\text{particles}}$.
        There are many implementation tricks in the EnKF; we describe the basic version here.

        For each time step \(t\), the ensemble is propagated forward by the transition model:

        $$
            \hat{x}_t^{(i)} = f(x_t^{(i)}, u_t, t_t) + \epsilon_t^{(i)},
        $$

        where \(u_t\) is the control input at time \(t\) and \(t_t\) is the time of the transition,
        and \(\epsilon_t^{(i)} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, Q)\) is the process noise.

        Each ensemble member is then updated using observations:

        $$
            x_t^{(i)} = \hat{x}_t^{(i)} + \hat{K}_t^{(i)} \left(y_t - h(x_t^{(i)}, u_t, t_t)\right),
        $$

        where $\hat{K}_t^{(i)}$ is the Kalman gain for the \(i\)-th ensemble member, computed as

        $$
            \hat{K}_t^{(i)} = \hat{P}_t^{(i)} H^\top (H \hat{P}_t^{(i)} H^\top + R)^{-1},
        $$

        where $\hat{P}_t^{(i)}$ is the empirical covariance of the particles, and $R$ is the
        covariance of the observation model.

        The resulting estimator is known to be biased for non-linear observations, but is often rather
        robust in practice to moderate nonlinearities. It is particualrly effective for high-dimensional
        inverse problems, where other particle methods like particle filters often struggle.

class PFResamplingConfig:
    """Resampling strategy for particle-based filters.

    The defaults (`"systematic"`, `"stop_gradient"`) are appropriate for most
    workflows. The resampling step includes both a non-differentiable base method,
    and a differentiable method for handling gradients.

    For most problems, especially with bootstrap particle filters, the `stop_gradient` method is preferred.
    The `soft` method can be useful when a non-bootstrap PF is used and gradients are required to flow through the resampling step.
    The `straight_through` approach is biased on the backwards pass, and is not recommended, but is okay to use for gradient-free inference.

    Attributes:
        base_method (ResamplingBaseMethod): Algorithm used to draw new
            particles from the weight distribution. `"systematic"` *(default)*
            has the lowest variance and is preferred in most cases.
            `"multinomial"` and `"stratified"` are also available.
        differential_method (ResamplingDifferentiableMethod): How gradients
            are handled across the discrete resampling step.
            `"stop_gradient"` *(default)* treats indices as constants.
            `"straight_through"` or `"soft"` allow gradients to pass through
            (needed for gradient-based training of model parameters).
        softness (float): Temperature for soft resampling. Only used when
            `differential_method="soft"`. Lower values are closer to non-differentiable resampling,
            and higher values are closer to the differentiable method. Defaults to `0.7`.

    ??? note "Algorithm Reference"
        The stop gradient method provides an unbiased score estimate for the marginal likelihood via the classical Fisher estimate.
        This is accomplished directly through automatic differentiation. For non-bootstrap filters, the proposal estimates will be biased.

        The soft resampling method provides biased score estimates, but propagates gradients through the reasmpling step. It is fast.

class PFConfig(BaseFilterConfig):
    r"""Bootstrap Particle Filter (PF) for discrete-time models.

    The most flexible filter: works with any model, including non-Gaussian
    observations and highly nonlinear dynamics.
    The main cost is that accuracy scales with the number of particles, so
    large state dimensions can become expensive.

    The primary tuning knob is `n_particles`. Estimates will generally get better
    and less noisy with more particles, but introduces a linear computational cost.
    `ess_threshold_ratio` controls the frequency of resampling; sampling more frequently
    can help avoid particle degeneracy, but also increases variance.

    NaN-valued `obs_values` are allowed, but they are not treated specially by
    the particle filter. Whether missing observations work correctly is up to
    the user-specified transition and observation functions to handle NaNs
    appropriately. A warning is emitted when NaNs are detected in `obs_values`.

    Attributes:
        n_particles (int): Number of particles. More particles give a lower-
            variance log-likelihood estimate at linear compute cost. Defaults
            to `1_000`.
        resampling_method (PFResamplingConfig): Controls the resampling
            algorithm and gradient behaviour. See `PFResamplingConfig`.
            Defaults to systematic resampling with stop-gradient.
        ess_threshold_ratio (float): Resampling fires when the effective
            sample size drops below `ess_threshold_ratio * n_particles`.
            `1.0` → always resample; `0.0` → never. Defaults to `0.7`.
        filter_source (FilterSource): Backend. Defaults to `"cuthbert"`, which is currently the only available implementation.

    ??? note "Algorithm Reference"
        At each step, particles are propagated through the transition and
        reweighted by the observation likelihood. The resulting empirical distribution
        is asymptotically exact to the true filtering distribution as the number of particles goes to infinity.
        The marginal log-likelihood without a resampling step is estimated as:

        \[
            \log p(y_{1:T}) \approx \sum_{t=1}^T \log \frac{1}{N}
            \sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{w}_t^{(i)}
        \]

        where $\tilde{w}_t^{(i)}$ is the are unnormalized weights of each particle.

        There are several different resampling algorithms available, which result in different
        approximations of the score function $\nabla_\theta \log p(y_{1:T} | \theta)$.
        For more information on these options, see `PFResamplingConfig`.

    ??? note "Algorithm Reference"
        When the dynamics and observation process of a dynamical system are both linear-Gaussian,
        the recursive updates can be computed in closed form.

        This proceeds via a "prediction" step, where the mean and covariance are propagated forward in time,
        and an "update" step, where the mean and covariance are updated with the observation.

        The prediction step is given by:

        $$
            \hat x_{t|t-1} = A \hat x_{t-1|t-1} + b,
            \quad P_{t|t-1} = A P_{t-1|t-1} A^\top + Q
        $$

        The update step is given by:

        $$
            \hat x_{t|t} = \hat x_{t|t-1} + K_t (y_t - H \hat x_{t|t-1}),
            \quad P_{t|t} = (I - K_t H) P_{t|t-1}
        $$

        where $K_t$ is the Kalman gain.

        The Kalman gain is given by:

        $$
            K_t = P_{t|t-1} H^\top (H P_{t|t-1} H^\top + R)^{-1}
        $$

        where $H$ is the Jacobian of $h$ at $\hat x_{t|t-1}$.

        There are variants to the particular algorithm; the `cuthbert` implementation is the so-called "square root" form.
        This provides a more numerically stable implementation of the Kalman filter.

    The default (and recommended) filter for factorial models with non-linear or

    Duffield et al. (2024). Each pairwise update linearizes the local observation
    via JAX autodiff (the cuthbert Taylor/linearized Kalman backend) over only the
    factors involved in that observation.

    Used only with a :class:`~dynestyx.models.FactorialDynamicalModel`; the factor
    indices for each observation are supplied via the ``obs_factor_indices``
    keyword of ``dsx.sample``. Associative/parallel-in-time scans are not

    Note:
        For *local* observations that depend only on a contrast of the involved
        factors (e.g. a match outcome depending on the skill *difference*), the
        Taylor linearization of the observation potential is rank-deficient, so
        the marginal log-likelihood is **not differentiable** through this filter
        (gradients are NaN). This matches Duffield et al. (2024), who estimate
        parameters via EM / dedicated estimators rather than autodiff. Use the

        trajectories), and prediction; for *gradient-based* parameter inference
