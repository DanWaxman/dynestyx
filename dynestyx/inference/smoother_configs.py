    r"""Shared base class for all smoother configs.

    You do not instantiate this class directly; use one of the concrete
    subclasses (e.g. `KFSmootherConfig`, `PFSmootherConfig`).

    Concrete smoother configs inherit from their corresponding filter configs,
    so backend selection, filter tuning, continuous-time solver options, and
    filter recording fields follow the same conventions as
    `dynestyx.inference.filter_configs`.

    The `record_smoothed_*` fields let you save intermediate smoothing outputs
    into the NumPyro trace as `numpyro.deterministic` sites, making them
    accessible after inference (e.g. for plotting smoothed trajectories).
    `None` defers to the backend's default for that quantity.

    Attributes:
        record_smoothed_states_mean (bool | None): Save the posterior smoothing
            mean \(\mathbb{E}[x_t \mid y_{1:T}]\) at each time step.
        record_smoothed_states_cov (bool | None): Save the full smoothing
            covariance at each time step. Can be large; prefer
            `record_smoothed_states_cov_diag` for high-dimensional states.
        record_smoothed_states_cov_diag (bool | None): Save only the marginal
            smoothing variances at each time step.
        record_smoothed_particles (bool | None): Save smoothed particles for
            particle smoothers.
        record_smoothed_log_weights (bool | None): Save smoothed particle log
            weights for particle smoothers.
        record_smoothed_states_chol_cov (bool | None): Save the Cholesky factor
            of the smoothing covariance when exposed by the backend.
        record_max_elems (int): Hard cap on total scalar elements saved across
            all `record_*` sites. Prevents accidentally filling device memory
            for long sequences or large state spaces. Defaults to `100_000`.

    r"""Rauch-Tung-Striebel Kalman Smoother (RTS) for discrete-time models.

    The exact Bayesian smoother for discrete-time linear-Gaussian state-space
    models. Use this when your model was built with `LTI_discrete` or with
    `LinearGaussianStateEvolution` + `LinearGaussianObservation`.

    The smoother computes \(p(x_t \mid y_{1:T})\), while `KFConfig` computes
    \(p(x_t \mid y_{1:t})\). Use the inherited `record_smoothed_*` fields to
    save smoothed means, covariances, or covariance diagonals in the NumPyro
    trace.

    Supports missing observations via NaNs when `filter_source="cuthbert"`. Does not support missing observations (data cannot have NaNs) when `filter_source="cd_dynamax"`.

    Attributes:
        filter_source (FilterSource): Backend. Defaults to `"cd_dynamax"`.
        associative (bool | None): Whether to enable cuthbert's associative
            parallel-in-time scan. This is only supported when
            `filter_source="cuthbert"`. Defaults to `None`, which selects
            an associative scan if `filter_source="cuthbert"`, and a
            sequential scan otherwise.

    ??? note "Algorithm Reference"
        After a forward Kalman filtering pass, the RTS smoother runs a backward
        recursion over the filtered and one-step-ahead predicted Gaussian
        states. For a linear transition matrix \(A_t\), the smoothing gain is

        $$
            G_t = P_{t|t} A_t^\top P_{t+1|t}^{-1}.
        $$

        The smoothed mean and covariance are then

        $$
            m_{t|T} = m_{t|t} + G_t (m_{t+1|T} - m_{t+1|t}),
        $$

        and

        $$
            P_{t|T} = P_{t|t}
                + G_t (P_{t+1|T} - P_{t+1|t}) G_t^\top.

class EKFSmootherConfig(EKFConfig, BaseSmootherConfig):
    r"""Extended Kalman Smoother (EKS) for discrete-time models.

    The Gaussian smoother corresponding to `EKFConfig`. Use this for
    differentiable nonlinear dynamics when local linearization is a reasonable
    approximation to the filtering and smoothing distributions.

    This is exact (but wasteful) for linear-Gaussian models. For those models,
    prefer `KFSmootherConfig`.

    The inherited ``use_taylor`` option selects moments vs Taylor linearization
    for both the forward (filter) and backward (RTS) passes; see
    :class:`EKFConfig`.

    Does not support missing observations (data cannot have NaNs).

    Attributes:
        filter_source (FilterSource): Backend. Defaults to `"cuthbert"`.

    ??? note "Algorithm Reference"
        The EKS applies the RTS backward recursion to the linear-Gaussian
        approximations produced by an EKF filtering pass. The transition matrix
        in the smoothing gain is the Jacobian of the transition function at the
        filtered mean:

        $$
            G_t = P_{t|t} F_t^\top P_{t+1|t}^{-1}.
        $$

        Smoothed means and covariances are then computed with the same
        backward recursion as `KFSmootherConfig`.

class UKFSmootherConfig(UKFConfig, BaseSmootherConfig):
    r"""Unscented Kalman Smoother (UKS) for discrete-time models.

    A derivative-free Gaussian smoother that handles nonlinearities by
    propagating deterministic sigma points rather than Jacobians. Use this when
    sigma-point propagation is a better local approximation than EKF
    linearization.

    This smoother is currently supported with `filter_source="cd_dynamax"` only.
    Cuthbert UKF smoothing is not implemented.

    Does not support missing observations (data cannot have NaNs).

    Attributes:
        alpha (float): Spread of sigma points around the current mean.
            Smaller → tighter cluster; larger → sigma points reach further.
            Defaults to \(\sqrt{3}\).
        beta (int): Encodes prior knowledge about the distribution shape.
            `2` is optimal for Gaussians. Defaults to `2`.
        kappa (int): Secondary scaling parameter. Defaults to `1`.
        filter_source (FilterSource): Backend. Defaults to `"cd_dynamax"`.

    ??? note "Algorithm Reference"
        The UKS uses a forward UKF pass followed by an RTS-style backward pass.
        Instead of using a Jacobian in the smoothing gain, it estimates the
        lag-one cross-covariance \(P_{t,t+1|t}\) by propagating sigma points:

        $$
            G_t = P_{t,t+1|t} P_{t+1|t}^{-1}.
        $$

        The smoothed mean and covariance then follow the same correction form
        as the Kalman and extended Kalman smoothers.

class PFSmootherConfig(PFConfig, BaseSmootherConfig):
    r"""Particle smoother for discrete-time models.

    Use this for nonlinear or non-Gaussian discrete-time models. Particle
    smoothing is more flexible than Gaussian smoothing, but accuracy scales
    with the number of particles and backward-sampled smoother trajectories.

    This smoother is currently supported with `filter_source="cuthbert"` only.

    Does not support missing observations (data cannot have NaNs).

    Attributes:
        n_particles (int): Number of particles in the forward particle filter.
            More particles give a lower-variance log-likelihood and smoothing
            approximation at linear compute cost. Defaults to `1_000`.
        pf_backward_sampling_method (PFBackwardSamplingMethod): Backward
            simulation method. `"tracing"` is the default, `"exact"` performs
            exact backward sampling where available, and `"mcmc"` uses an MCMC
            backward kernel.

            is currently the only available implementation.

    ??? note "Algorithm Reference"
        Particle smoothers augment a forward particle filter with a backward
        pass that reconstructs trajectories from the particle approximation to
        the filtering distributions.

        In backward simulation, a sampled state \(x_{t+1}^{(j)}\) chooses an
        ancestor at time \(t\) with probabilities proportional to

        $$
            w_t^{(i)} p(x_{t+1}^{(j)} \mid x_t^{(i)}).
        $$

        The `"tracing"` method follows stored particle ancestors. The `"exact"`
        and `"mcmc"` methods use backward kernels that can better approximate
        the full smoothing distribution at higher compute cost.

        smoothing equations through the filtered trajectory.

        The result is the continuous-discrete analogue of the RTS smoother:
        each state is conditioned on all observations \(y_{1:T}\), not just the
