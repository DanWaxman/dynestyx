    Samples from a dynamical model. This is the main primitive of dynestyx.

    The `sample` primitive is meant to mimic the `numpyro.sample` primitive in usage,
    but using a `DynamicalModel` instead of a `Distribution`.

    The `sample` method calls `_sample_intp`, which is defined as a `defop` in `effectful`.
    This is where any real "work" is done, after input validation.

    Shape note:
        Inside ``dsx.plate``, observation arrays use leading plate axes followed
        by time and event axes, e.g. ``(N, T, obs_dim)``. Model parameters follow
        the same leading-plate, trailing-event convention. See :class:`plate`
        for the full plated-shape contract.

    Parameters:
        name: Name of the sample site.
        dynamics: Dynamical model to sample from.
        obs_times: Times at which to sample the observations.
        obs_values: Values of the observations at the given times.
        ctrl_times: Times at which to sample the controls.
        ctrl_values: Values of the controls at the given times.
        predict_times: Times at which to predict the observations.
        obs_factor_indices: For a `FactorialDynamicalModel` only, an integer array
            of shape `(num_observations, num_local_factors)` giving the factor
            (e.g. team) indices involved in each observation (e.g. home/away).

            `(num_predictions, num_local_factors)` indices for `predict_times`.

class plate(ObjectInterpretation):
    """Hierarchical plate for batched trajectories.

    ``dsx.plate`` wraps ``numpyro.plate`` for parameter sampling semantics and
    intercepts ``dsx.sample`` to pass plate sizes to simulator and filter
    handlers. Use it when a dynamical system has conditionally independent
    members, such as multiple trajectories, patients, groups, or treatment
    arms.

    Shape semantics:
        Dynestyx treats plate axes as leading data-batch axes. Time axes come
        after plate axes in observation arrays, and state/observation event axes
        remain trailing axes.

        For one plate of size ``N``:

        ```python
        obs_values          # (N, T, obs_dim), or (N, T) for scalar observations
        mu_i                # (N, state_dim), a vector parameter per trajectory
        initial_mean        # (N, state_dim), or shared as (state_dim,)
        initial_cov         # (N, state_dim, state_dim), or shared as (state_dim, state_dim)
        prior["f_states"]   # (num_samples, N, n_sim, T, state_dim)
        ```

        Distribution-valued model components use their NumPyro
        ``batch_shape``/``event_shape`` split: leading plate dimensions are
        batch dimensions, while state and observation sizes are inferred from
        ``event_shape``. Thus a batched initial condition may have
        ``loc.shape == (N, state_dim)`` with either shared or batched covariance.

        Built-in LTI vector fields, including transition/drift and observation
        biases, may be shared or plate-batched:

        ```python
        with dsx.plate("trajectories", N):
            mu_i = numpyro.sample(
                "mu_i",
                dist.Normal(mu_global, sigma).to_event(1),
            )  # (N, state_dim)

            dynamics = LTI_discrete(
                A=A,
                Q=Q,
                H=H,
                R=R,
                b=mu_i,              # plate-batched vector bias
                initial_mean=mu_i,   # plate-batched initial mean
            )
        ```

        Ambiguous arrays are kept shared rather than sliced. In particular, a
        shared vector whose length happens to equal ``N`` is not treated as
        plate-batched unless it is a known vector-valued model field with an
        explicit event axis, such as ``(N, state_dim)``. For one-dimensional
        vector fields, prefer explicit singleton event axes like ``(N, 1)``.
        Nested plates follow the same rule with multiple leading plate axes.

    Why event shapes drive sizing:
        Inside a plate, ``state_dim`` and ``observation_dim`` are inferred from
        a distribution's NumPyro ``event_shape``, not from the full sample
        shape. The full sample shape includes leading plate batch axes, which
        are independent-member dimensions, not event dimensions; using it
        would misread ``(N, d)`` as ``state_dim == N``. Sticking to
        ``event_shape`` keeps the per-member event size unambiguous.

        The contract for a single plate of size ``N``:

        | Sampled shape   | event_shape   | Interpretation                   |
        | --------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
        | ``(d,)``        | ``(d,)``      | Shared vector event, broadcast.  |
        | ``(N, d)``      | ``(d,)``      | Per-member vector event of dim d.|
        | ``(N,)``        | ``()``        | Per-member **scalar** event.     |

        The third row is the subtle one: ``dist.Normal(mu, sigma)`` with
        ``mu.shape == (N,)`` produces ``event_shape == ()``, which we treat as
        ``state_dim == 1``. If the intent is a 1-D *vector* state with one
        entry per member, wrap with ``.to_event(1)`` or use a vector-valued
        distribution (``dist.MultivariateNormal``) so the rank-1 axis is an
        event axis. This is the same ambiguity rule as the shared-vector case
        above, applied at the distribution level.

        Nested plates extend this with multiple leading batch axes; the inner
        plate is the leftmost data batch axis, matching NumPyro's convention.

    Output axis ordering:
        Predictive draws and filter outputs preserve a consistent axis order:

        ``(num_samples, *plate_axes_inner_to_outer, n_sim, T, *event_shape)``

        For example, with one plate of size ``N`` and a vector state:

        ```python
        prior["f_states"]        # (num_samples, N, n_sim, T, state_dim)
        prior["f_observations"]  # (num_samples, N, n_sim, T, obs_dim)
        ```

        ``num_samples`` comes first (NumPyro ``Predictive``), then plate axes
        from inner to outer (the inner plate is the leftmost data batch axis,
        so it appears immediately after ``num_samples``), then ``n_sim`` from
        the simulator, then time, then the event axes. ``flatten_draws`` is
        the standard helper for collapsing ``(num_samples, n_sim)`` for
        plotting/credible intervals.

    Examples:
        >>> with dsx.plate("trajectories", M):
        ...     theta = numpyro.sample("theta", dist.Normal(0, 1))  # shape (M,)
        ...     dynamics = DynamicalModel(...)  # built from theta
        ...     dsx.sample("f", dynamics, obs_times=t, obs_values=y)

        >>> with dsx.plate("groups", G):
        ...     beta = numpyro.sample("beta", dist.Normal(0, 1))  # shape (G,)
        ...     with dsx.plate("trajectories", M):
        ...         alpha = numpyro.sample("alpha", dist.Normal(beta, 1))  # shape (M, G)
        ...         dynamics = DynamicalModel(...)  # built from alpha
        ...         dsx.sample("f", dynamics, obs_times=t, obs_values=y)

    Sharp edges:
        - **Drift/diffusion must be sliceable pytrees.** Plated parameters must be
          stored as array fields of an ``eqx.Module``, not captured in a Python
          closure. A closure-captured variable is invisible to pytree munging,
          and can introduce shape errors. The built-in components (``AffineDrift``,
          ``LTI_continuous``, ``FullDiffusion``, etc.) follow this rule. See the
          hierarchical inference tutorial (``08_hierarchical_inference.ipynb``) for
          the full sharp-edges list including event-shape vs. sample-shape rules and
          the rank-1 shared/batched ambiguity.
